\section{Technique}
\label{sec:technique}

\todo{This section or sections explains the new techniques we used to solve the problem.
  Often, you'll want to put multiple sections here: for example, you might have an overview
  followed by a section of proofs---but it will depend on the exact content of the paper.
  Optionally, it may be preceded by a ``Background'' section that gives relevant context:
  for example, in papers about new Checker Framework checkers, we often include a background
  section that explains what type qualifiers and pluggable types are, the
  annotation syntax, etc.}

\todo{Give all sections descriptive names, not something bland like
  ``Technique'' that could appear in any paper.  Make your section names
  work for you.}
