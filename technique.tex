\section{Technique}
\label{sec:technique}

\todo{This section or sections explains the new techniques we used to solve the problem.
  Often, you'll want to put multiple sections here: for example, you might have an overview
  followed by a section of proofs---but it will depend on the exact content of the paper.
  Optionally, it may be preceded by a ``Background'' section that gives relevant context:
  for example, in papers about new Checker Framework checkers, we often include a background
  section that explains what type qualifiers and pluggable types are, the
  annotation syntax, etc.}

\todo{Give all sections descriptive names, not something bland like
  ``Technique'' that could appear in any paper.  Make your section names
  work for you.}

\todo{Avoid ``anthromorphism'' when describing automated steps taken by tools. For example, avoid phrases like ``we enforce immutability...'', ``we make eligible resource fields final whenever possible...'', ``we introduce a temporary variable...'', etc., because \textbf{we} (the authors) do not actually do these things. Instead, our tool does them!

It's important to be precise about this in technical writing, because we want to distinguish between things that we (the authors) do manually and things that our tool does automatically. The use of ``we'' for things done automatically by the tool can incorrectly give the impression that we (the authors) had to be involved in those things directly, which is incorrect.

\todo{A note about todos: when a co-author (especially a senior co-author) leaves a
  todo for you, especially in a technical or experimental section, there are two
  ways to address it:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If the todo points out a valid issue with the text (e.g., if the todo says ``does Y include Z?'',
    the text suggests that the answer is ``no'', but the actual answer is ``yes''), then \emph{change the text and delete the todo}. Do not just add
    more todo text saying ``yes'': instead, address the issue in the text directly, so that the next
    reader doesn't have the same question.
  \item If the todo is incorrect (e.g., if the todo says ``does Y include Z?'', the text suggests ``no'', and the answer really is ``no''),
    then it \emph{may} be appropriate to edit the todo to answer the question (don't just delete the todo!).
    In this case, your senior co-author can confirm that the text is correct and then \emph{comment out the todo},
    so that if another senior co-author has the same concern in the future they will find the commented-out todo
    as they try to write their own. Sometimes, though, the best course of action is to edit the text to be more explicit:
    most questions that your senior co-authors ask are going to be similar to the concerns raised by reviewers.
  \end{itemize}
