\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

\todo{A related work section is not just a list of similar papers:
  its goal is to place this paper in context amongst the larger field.
  That means that anything you discuss in this section needs to not
  only be \emph{explained} on its own, but also must be \emph{compared}
  to the work described in this paper. When drafting, I usually start
  with just a list of related papers, and create the real related work
  section towards the end of the process (once the work in this paper has
  stabilized).}

\todo{Write a citation as ``WPI\textasciitilde\textbackslash
cite\{KelloggDNAE2023\}''
(which formats as ``WPI~\cite{KelloggDNAE2023}'')
and not as ``WPI\textbackslash cite\{KelloggmDNAE2023\}''
(which formats as ``WPI\cite{KelloggDNAE2023}'' with the citation jammed
against the preceding word).
That is, precede each use of \<\textbackslash cite> by a non-breaking
space, which is written as ``\<\textasciitilde>'' in a \<.tex> file.}
