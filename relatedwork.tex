\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

\todo{A related work section is not just a list of similar papers:
  its goal is to place this paper in context amongst the larger field.
  That means that anything you discuss in this section needs to not
  only be \emph{explained} on its own, but also must be \emph{compared}
  to the work described in this paper. When drafting, I usually start
  with just a list of related papers, and create the real related work
  section towards the end of the process (once the work in this paper has
  stabilized).}

\todo{Note that when adding a citation, you should always put a non-breaking
  space (\<\textasciitilde> in the \<.tex> file) before calling the \<\\cite> macro. So, your
  citation should look like:}
\begin{verbatim}
WPI~\cite{KelloggDNAE2023}
\end{verbatim}
\todo{and not:}
\begin{verbatim}
WPI\cite{KelloggmDNAE2023}
\end{verbatim}
