\section{Conclusion}

\todo{Recap the contributions of the paper.  (In fact, it is good to think of
  this as a ``contributions'' section even if it's titled ``conclusion''.)
  This section can do so in more depth or with more reference to techniques
  and insights than the abstract and introduction were able to do, since
  readers of those sections wouldn't have read the whole paper yet.
  In other cases, this section is brief.}
