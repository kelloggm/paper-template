\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

\todo{Any paper that involves building a tool should include an ``implementation'' section.
  It may discuss a new tool you have built and/or the experimental infrastructure.
  Discuss the key non-obvious design decisions and complications.
  You should also mention: 1) what language the tool targets, 2) any important libraries that
  the tool relies on (\eg the Checker Framework), and 3) that the tool is
  open-source.

  Sometimes this section is very short.}
