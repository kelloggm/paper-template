\section{Limitations and Threats to Validity}
\label{sec:limitations}

\todo{This section is required in SE papers. You should familiarize yourself
  with the terms ``internal'', ``external'', and ``construct'' threats to
  validity, and be prepared to use them to discuss your experiments in this
  section.

  One description appears at
  \url{https://github.com/mernst/uwisdom/blob/wiki/Research.adoc} (search
  for ``Threats'') but perhaps it can be improved.}
